# LDB-Bypass-UDTECH
In this project, I developed a Python-based solution to bypass screenshot detection mechanisms in various applications, enhancing the ability to analyze and document restricted content for research purposes. The core of the implementation utilizes ChatGPT for dynamic content transformation, such as converting screenshots to text, reformatting sensitive data, or even simulating user actions to avoid detection triggers.
